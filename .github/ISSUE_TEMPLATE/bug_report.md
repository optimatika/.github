Before you create an issue; did you try with latest version?

1) Explain, clearly, what the prolem is and how to reproduce it.
2) Create a test case that demonstrates the prolem
3) If you think you know how to fix the prolem then do it and submit a pull request (PR). Even if you don't know how to fix the prolem that test case could go in a PR.
