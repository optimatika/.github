# Optimatika can help with ALL those things!

ojAlgo exists because, a long time ago, one of Optimatika's clients needed a (pure Java) QP solver. None were available, so we decided to build one. Since then ojAlgo has grown immensely in scope and capabilities. Over the years, maintenance and further development has in part been sponsored by various client projects, but mainly it has been a hobby project (sponsored by Optimatika or [Anders Peterson](https://github.com/apete) personally).

Optimatika provides ojAlgo support. We believe the best way to do this is to form long term partnerships with organisations (whos code base) depend on ojAlgo.

Many organisation and development teams find it difficult to recruit talent.

If you have, or plan to get, a dependency on ojAlgo AND is in need of additional developers, Optimatika can help you!

The best way, for you, to assert continued development of ojAlgo is to team up with Optimatika.
